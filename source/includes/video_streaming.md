### Description:

This API allows to get the list of video streams avalibale and view the live stream.

### API usage information:

<aside class="notice">
    Keep an eye out, for this API needs a port at the end of the IP set to <strong>8080</strong>.
</aside>

* To view the video of a particular stream from the list of streams you need to create an **img** tag add the link to its source.

    `<img src='http://<ip>/stream?topic=<link to stream1>'>`

* Tip: You can add the following parameters as query string to the link for lighter or better resolution video quality.
width, height, quality, rate:1/2/3

        1. **1** will send out every frame,

        2. **2** will send out every second frame,

        3. **3** every third and so on...

* Tip: To stop the video stream you need to delete the **img** tag completely.

* Tip: To take a snapshot of the stream replace the word stream with snapshot in the link.

    `<img src='http://<ip>/snapshot?topic=<link to stream1>'>`

### Parameters:
    
    Following parameters are applicable in RESTful, Websocket. However the description of these parameters applies to all platforms. 
    
    Arguments:
    
    Argument | Type | Description
    -------------- | -------------- | --------------
    namespace | string | namespace used in FlytOS   
    
    Output:
    
    Parameter | Type | Description
    ---------- | ---------- | ------------
    stream1 | string | link of the video stream1
    stream2 | string | link of the video stream2
    stream3 | string | link of the video stream3
    .
    .
    .

### RESTful endpoint:

FlytOS hosts a RESTful server which listens on port **80**. RESTful APIs can be called from remote platform of your choice.

* URL: `POST http://<ip>/list_streams`
* JSON Request:
`{
    namespace: <namespace of FlytOS>
}`

* JSON Response:
`{
    stream1: <link to stream1>,
    stream2: <link to stream2>,
    stream3: <link to stream3>,
    stream4: <link to stream4>,
    stream5: <link to stream5>,
    .
    .
    .    
}`
